# Mastermind

Machine class - Picks up random word from dictionary, user interaction.
Util class - Filters list on each guessed word. Also generates the initial Map.
Main class - Basic I/O

Logic - Keep filtering down the list of possible Sorted words by eliminating all impossible Sorted Words from the list based on the number of matches till you get only one sorted word. Check all the anagrams of that word from the HashMap.
